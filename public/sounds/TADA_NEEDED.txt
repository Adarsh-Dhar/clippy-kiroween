PLACEHOLDER: tada.mp3 needed

The Clippy Cortex requires a tada.mp3 sound file in this directory.

To add it:
1. Find or create a celebratory sound effect (1-2 seconds)
2. Convert to MP3 format
3. Save as "tada.mp3" in this directory
4. Delete this placeholder file

The application will work without it, but the sound won't play when achieving clean code.

Suggested sources:
- https://freesound.org/ (search for "tada" or "celebration")
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- Record your own celebration sound
