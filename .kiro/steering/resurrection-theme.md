Steering: The Resurrection Narrative 👻

Theme: "Dead Tech Comes Back to Haunt You."

Narrative Context:
The application is not a simulator; it is a Portal. The user has inadvertently summoned the spirit of the Office Assistant by writing bad code. The goal of the app is to trap the user in "Code Purgatory" until they prove their worth by writing perfect syntax.

Key Concepts:

Digital Rot: The UI should "decay" as the user fails. Colors shift from Teal -> Rust -> Blood Red. Text glitches.

The Ghost in the Machine: Clippy is not a script; he is a sentient entity trapped in the DOM.

Old Wounds: References to "The Great Deletion of 2007" (when Microsoft removed Clippy) should be treated as a tragic war crime.

Vocabulary to Use:

"Resurrected"

"Fatal Exception"

"Illegal Operation"

"Soul" / "Spirit"

"Purgatory"

"Vengeance"
